 * 
 * 7. University of Georgia Extension
 *    "Bermudagrass: The Sports Turf of the South"
 *    https://extension.uga.edu/
 *    - Bermudagrass Kc values: 0.85-1.0 during active growth
 *    - Dormancy period coefficients: 0.4-0.5
 * 
 * 8. Irrigation Association
 *    "Landscape Irrigation Scheduling and Water Management" (2014)
 *    https://www.irrigation.org/
 *    - Practical Kc ranges for residential turf
 *    - Adjustment factors for microclimates and management
 * 
 * GRASS-SPECIFIC SOURCES:
 * 
 * Kentucky Bluegrass & Perennial Ryegrass:
 * - Penn State Extension: "Turfgrass Water Requirements"
 * - Michigan State University Extension
 * - Kc range: 0.80-1.0 (active growth), 0.5-0.7 (dormancy)
 * 
 * Tall Fescue:
 * - Virginia Tech Extension
 * - Kansas State University Research
 * - More drought-tolerant: Kc = 0.75-0.90
 * 
 * Bermudagrass:
 * - University of Arkansas Extension
 * - Oklahoma State University Turfgrass Research
 * - Peak season Kc: 0.85-1.0, Dormancy: 0.4-0.5
 * 
 * St. Augustine:
 * - University of Florida IFAS
 * - LSU AgCenter
 * - Kc range: 0.70-0.95
 * 
 * Zoysiagrass:
 * - NC State Extension
 * - Mississippi State Extension
 * - Moderate water needs: Kc = 0.65-0.85
 * 
 * Buffalo Grass:
 * - Colorado State University Extension
 * - Nebraska Extension
 * - Very drought-tolerant: Kc = 0.60-0.75
 * 
 * Fine Fescues:
 * - University of Minnesota Extension
 * - Cornell Cooperative Extension
 * - Shade-tolerant, lower Kc: 0.65-0.85
 * 
 * NOTES ON GROWTH STAGES AND SEASONAL VARIATIONS:
 * 
 * 1. Dormancy Periods:
 *    - Cool-season grasses: Summer semi-dormancy and winter slowdown
 *    - Warm-season grasses: Complete winter dormancy
 *    - Kc values reduced by 30-50% during dormancy
 * 
 * 2. Month Ranges:
 *    - Generalized for USDA Zones 5-8 (temperate US)
 *    - Should be adjusted based on:
 *      * Local climate and hardiness zone
 *      * Actual green-up and dormancy dates
 *      * Latitude and elevation
 * 
 * 3. Transition Periods:
 *    - Spring green-up: Kc gradually increases over 2-4 weeks
 *    - Fall dormancy: Kc gradually decreases over 2-4 weeks
 *    - Values interpolated between active growth and dormancy
 * 
 * 4. Management Factors Affecting Kc:
 *    - Mowing height (higher = higher Kc)
 *    - Fertility level (high fertility = higher ET)
 *    - Cultivar selection (some varieties more drought-tolerant)
 *    - Thatch accumulation (affects water penetration)
 * 
 * RECOMMENDED ADJUSTMENTS FOR PRODUCTION USE:
 * 
 * 1. Climate Zone Integration:
 *    - Link grass types to USDA hardiness zones
 *    - Adjust month ranges by latitude (Â±2 weeks per 300 miles)
 *    - Consider microclimate effects (urban heat island, elevation)
 * 
 * 2. Local Validation:
 *    - Cross-reference with local extension office recommendations
 *    - Adjust for regional climate patterns
 *    - Consider soil type interactions
 * 
 * 3. User Customization:
 *    - Allow override of Kc values based on observed conditions
 *    - Provide management level adjustments (basic, moderate, premium)
 *    - Account for irrigation system efficiency
 * 
 * 4. Seasonal Learning:
 *    - Track actual vs. predicted water use
 *    - Adjust coefficients based on turf quality observations
 *    - Integrate weather station feedback
 * 
 * DATA VALIDATION:
 * 
 * All Kc values in lookup.json fall within established ranges from the sources above.
 * Values represent typical residential lawn conditions with:
 * - Regular mowing at recommended heights
 * - Moderate fertility programs
 * - Standard cultivars (not ultra-drought-tolerant varieties)
 * - Level terrain with good drainage
 * 
 * LAST UPDATED: October 2025
 * FAO-56 published 1998 (current standard)
 * Extension publications: 2020-2024
